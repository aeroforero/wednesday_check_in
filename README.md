# Wednesday Midterm Check In

 - Please fork this repo to check in for the midterm. This is to help us know who is here, since some students requested to attend a section for which they are not enrolled.
 - Just click the "Fork" button; you don't have to clone or anything.
    - If you haven't clicked the button by 6:02pm, you'll likely have to come up front and give me your GitHub username individually.
 - In a moment, navigate back to https://github.com/appdevspring17 and refresh.
 - You'll see a banner across the top of that page with an invitation from me to join a team. Accept it.
 - Two new repositories will appear in the list: `geometer` and `very_best_debug`. These two are the midterm.
 - The first one, Geometer, contains the general instructions for the midterm. Read all of the instructions carefully before you begin.
 - Take less than half of the 90 minutes for Geometer before you move on to part 2, Very Best Debug.
 - The exam ends at 7:35pm and class begins again at 7:55pm.
